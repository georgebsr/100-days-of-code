# About
This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through 100 days of learning and coding with codecademy.com. I will be uploading the projects I build on codecademy or in general here.

# Motivation
I started this challenge to improve my backend development skills and become more confident in building real-world projects. This repository will showcase my progress along the way.

# Day 1-15
## Back-End Engineer career path
Started the Back-End Engineer career path on codecademy.com

# Day 15
## Sleep Debt Calculator
This project calculates your sleep debt by comparing the hours you've slept each night with your ideal sleep goal. It gives feedback on whether you're getting enough sleep and tracks your progress over time.

# Day 16
## JavaScript Syntax: Scope
Learned about:
- Global scope
- Module scope
- Function scope
- Code block scope

# Day 17
## Leetcode
I had very little free time today, so I solved some easy Leetcode challenges.

# Day 18 
## JavaScript Syntax: Training Days
Today, I worked on the Training Days project, which focuses on improving variable scope in JavaScript. The project simulates a training schedule for athletes by assigning them a random event and determining how many days they need to train.

## Concepts Learned:
- Global vs. Local Scope: Moved variables to the appropriate scope to avoid unexpected behavior.
- Function Parameters: Made functions more reusable by passing variables as arguments instead of relying on global scope.
- Code Optimization: Reduced redundant variable declarations and improved maintainability.

# Day 21
## JavaScript Practice: Data Types, Conditional, Functions
Practiced JavaScript conditionals and functions with these code challenges:
I also brushed up on running JavaScript in the browser console and JavaScript runtime environments.

# Day 22
## Number Guesser
Today, I completed the Number Guesser project from Codecademy's JavaScript Syntax, Part I. This project focused on writing JavaScript functions to power a small guessing game that runs in the browser.

### Learned concepts:
- Generating random numbers with Math.random()
- Using Math.abs() to calculate absolute differences
- Implementing game logic using conditional statements
- Keeping track of scores and rounds

### Features implemented:
- generateTarget() – Generates a random number between 0 and 9.
- compareGuesses() – Determines the winner by comparing guesses to the target number. The human player wins in case of a tie.
- updateScore() – Updates the score based on the round’s winner.
- advanceRound() – Increments the round counter.
- getAbsoluteDistance() – Refactored distance calculation into a separate function.
- Input validation – Prevents users from entering numbers outside the 0-9 range.

# Day 23 & Day 24
## Break
No coding these days as I was in the village without access to a PC. Taking a short break!

# Day 25
## Secret Message
Today, I worked on a JavaScript challenge that involved manipulating arrays using various array methods. The goal was to transform an array of words into a secret message by performing different operations like removing, adding, and replacing elements.

### Learned concepts:
- Array methods such as .pop(), .push(), .shift(), .unshift(), and .splice() for modifying arrays.
- Using indexing to directly change values within an array.
- Using .join(' ') to convert an array into a readable string

[SecretMessage.js](https://github.com/georgebsr/100-days-of-code/blob/main/Secret%20Message/secretmessage.js)

# Day 26
## Loops & Whale Talk
Today, I revisited loops in JavaScript and worked on a fun mini-project that translates a phrase into whale language! 
Loops are incredibly useful for string manipulation! This challenge was a great refresher on iteration and conditional logic. 
The rules for whale talk:
- Only vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are used.
- "e" and "u" are doubled.
- The final output is in uppercase to match the whale's singing style.

### Used/Learned concepts:
- For loops to iterate through strings.
- Nested loops for comparing characters against an array.
- .push() method to add elements to an array dynamically.
- .join() method to convert an array into a string.
- .toUpperCase() to modify string case.

[WhaleTalk.js](https://github.com/georgebsr/100-days-of-code/blob/main/Whale%20Talk/whaletalk.js)

# Day 27
## JavaScript Objects
Today, I didn’t write any actual code, but I still made progress by revisiting JavaScript Objects on Codecademy. Since work kept me busy, I focused on learning exercises related to objects instead of a full project.

# Day 28
## Advanced Objects
Today, I deepened my understanding of JavaScript Objects, focusing on Advanced Objects. I explored more complex concepts that make objects even more powerful in JavaScript.

# Day 29
## Getters, Setters & Factory functions
Today, I learned about getters and setters in JavaScript, and how they help control how object properties are accessed and modified. I also explored factory functions and applied my knowledge in a small project.

## Meal Maker
I built a Meal Maker program for a restaurant, which allows setting a daily special meal and its price while ensuring data integrity using getters and setters.

[MealMaker.js](https://github.com/georgebsr/100-days-of-code/blob/main/Meal%20Maker/mealmaker.js)

## Key Concepts Applied:
- Encapsulation using private properties (_meal, _price)
- Setters to validate input types before assigning values
- Getters to format and return readable output
- Logical validation to ensure both meal and price exist

# Day 30 & Day 31
## Break
No coding these days as I was in the village without access to a PC. Taking a short break!

# Day 32
## Practicing JavaScript concepts
Today, I took a break from the curriculum and focused on practicing JavaScript concepts through exercises on Codecademy.

My progress so far:

# Day 33
## Team Stats
Today, I worked on a project called Team Stats. I created a JavaScript object that holds information about a sports team, including players and game data. I also implemented methods for adding new players and game results to the data.

- Created a team object with properties for players and games
- Implemented getter methods to retrieve player and game data
- Added methods to add new players and record new games
- Validated the methods by adding new player Bugs Bunny and a game against the Titans

[TeamStats.js](https://github.com/georgebsr/100-days-of-code/blob/main/Team%20Stats/teamstats.js)

# Day 34
## Leetcode
I had no free time today because of interviews and some personal stuff. 
I solved some Leetcode challenges in JS so as not to break the streak.

# Day 35
## Iterators and Higher-Order Functions
Today, I focused on JavaScript Iterators and Higher-Order Functions. I explored how functions like .forEach(), .map(), .filter(), and .reduce() can be used to iterate over arrays in a more concise and functional way.

## Concepts Practiced:
- forEach() – Executed a function on each element in an array
- map() – Created a new array by applying a function to each element
- filter() – Returned an array with elements that passed a specific condition
- reduce() – Combined array elements into a single value (sum, product, etc.)

# Day 36
Had no free time due to work & personal stuff but stayed consistent by studying MDN docs on iterators & practicing in VS Code—focused on .forEach(), .map(), .filter(), .reduce(), custom iterators, and debugging; key takeaway: reading helps, but coding makes it stick!

# Day 37 & Day 38
## Break
No coding these days as I was in the village without access to a PC. Taking a short break!

# Day 39
Today I worked on my thesis.

# Day 40
## SQL Manipulation
Took a break from JavaScript & revised SQL manipulation via Codecademy—created, updated, & deleted data in a friends table, added an email column, updated records, and practiced key SQL commands like CREATE TABLE, INSERT, UPDATE, ALTER, & DELETE. 
Work & personal stuff still keeping me busy, but the streak continues!

[Table.sql](https://github.com/georgebsr/100-days-of-code/blob/main/Create%20a%20Table/table.sql)

# Day 41
## SQL Queries
Continued SQL revision—focused on querying & filtering data effectively; covered SELECT, AS, DISTINCT, WHERE, LIKE, BETWEEN, AND, OR, ORDER BY, LIMIT, & CASE

# Day 42
## Queries Challenges
Completed some SQL challenges on the codecademy platform.
Pausing tomorrow in solidarity with the protest over the Tempi accident.

# Day 43
Pausing today because I will be in the protest over the Tempi accident.
