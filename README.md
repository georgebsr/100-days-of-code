# About

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through 100 days of learning and coding with codecademy.com. I will be uploading the projects I build on codecademy here.

# Motivation

I started this challenge to improve my backend development skills and become more confident in building real-world projects. This repository will showcase my progress along the way.

# Day 15
## Sleep Debt Calculator

This project calculates your sleep debt by comparing the hours you've slept each night with your ideal sleep goal. It gives feedback on whether you're getting enough sleep and tracks your progress over time.

# Day 16
## JavaScript Syntax: Scope

Learned about:
- Global scope
- Module scope
- Function scope
- Code block scope

# Day 17
## Leetcode

I had very little free time today so all I did was to solve some easy Leetcode challenges.

# Day 18 
## JavaScript Syntax: Training Days

Today, I worked on the Training Days project, which focuses on improving variable scope in JavaScript. The project simulates a training schedule for athletes by assigning them a random event and determining how many days they need to train.

## Concepts Learned:

-Global vs. Local Scope: Moved variables to the appropriate scope to avoid unexpected behavior.
-Function Parameters: Made functions more reusable by passing variables as arguments instead of relying on global scope.
-Code Optimization: Reduced redundant variable declarations and improved maintainability.
