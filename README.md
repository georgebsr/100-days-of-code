# About

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through 100 days of learning and coding with codecademy.com. I will be uploading the projects I build on codecademy here.

# Motivation

I started this challenge to improve my backend development skills and become more confident in building real-world projects. This repository will showcase my progress along the way.
