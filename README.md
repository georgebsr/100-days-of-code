# About

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through 100 days of learning and coding with codecademy.com. I will be uploading the projects I build on codecademy here.

# Motivation

I started this challenge to improve my backend development skills and become more confident in building real-world projects. This repository will showcase my progress along the way.


## Sleep Debt Calculator (Day 15)

This project calculates your sleep debt by comparing the hours you've slept each night with your ideal sleep goal. It gives feedback on whether you're getting enough sleep and tracks your progress over time.
