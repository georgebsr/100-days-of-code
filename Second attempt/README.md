# 100 Days of Code - Second Attempt

## Day 1
### Project: Analyze Data with SQL
**Platform:** Codecademy  

In this project, I worked on helping Reputable Product Agency (RPA) detect fraudulent transactions by analyzing a dataset. I wrote multiple SQL queries to identify suspicious activities, such as transactions from unusual zip codes, fraudulent names, and invalid IP addresses.

### Tasks Completed:
1. Retrieved the first 10 rows of the `transaction_data` table to understand its structure.
2. Found transactions with zip code `20252` (suspicious transactions).
3. Identified transactions with fraudulent pseudonyms like ‘Art Vandelay’ or names with ‘der’.
4. Retrieved transactions from internal IP addresses starting with '10.'.
5. Found transactions using temporary email addresses with the domain `temp_email.com`.
6. Queried for a specific transaction from a ‘John’ with an IP address starting with ‘120.’.

### Solution:
```sql
-- 1. Get column names
SELECT * FROM transaction_data LIMIT 10;

-- 2. Find the full_names and emails for zip code 20252
SELECT full_name, email FROM transaction_data WHERE zip = 20252;

-- 3. Find names and emails associated with fraudulent pseudonyms
SELECT full_name, email
FROM transaction_data
WHERE full_name = 'Art Vandelay'
   OR full_name LIKE '% der %';

-- 4. Find IP addresses and emails from internal IP addresses
SELECT ip_address, email
FROM transaction_data
WHERE ip_address LIKE '10.%';

-- 5. Find emails with temporary email domain
SELECT email
FROM transaction_data
WHERE email LIKE '%temp_email.com';

-- 6. Find transaction with full_name starting with 'John' and IP address starting with '120.'
SELECT *
FROM transaction_data
WHERE full_name LIKE 'John%'
  AND ip_address LIKE '120.%';

-- 7. Challenge: Return customers residing in GA based on zip code prefixes
SELECT *
FROM transaction_data
WHERE zip LIKE '30%'
   OR zip LIKE '31%'
   OR zip LIKE '39%';
```

## Day 2
### Project: RPA Customer Segmentation
**Platform:** Codecademy  
**Topic:** SQL Queries for User Segmentation  

In this project, I worked on segmenting users for Reputable Product Agency’s (RPA) marketing department. The goal was to filter users based on specific criteria to optimize marketing campaigns.  

### Tasks Completed:
1. Retrieved the first 20 rows of the `users` table to understand its structure.
2. Identified users born in the 1980s for a targeted email campaign.
3. Queried users who signed up before May 2017.
4. Filtered users who were part of an A/B test that displayed ‘bears’ clipart.
5. Retrieved users who were part of an ad campaign on website `BBB`.
6. Found users who received ad copy 2 in their campaign.
7. Identified users who received both a campaign and a test.
8. (Challenge) Calculated how old users were when they signed up.

### Solution:
```sql
-- 1. Get column names
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 20;

-- 2. Find emails and birthdays of users born in the 1980s
SELECT email, birthday FROM users WHERE birthday BETWEEN '1980-01-01' AND '1989-12-31';

-- 3. Find emails and creation dates of users who signed up before May 2017
SELECT email, created_at FROM users WHERE created_at <= '2017-05-31';

-- 4. Find emails of users who received the ‘bears’ test
SELECT email FROM users WHERE test = 'bears';

-- 5. Find emails of users who received a campaign on website BBB
SELECT email FROM users WHERE campaign LIKE 'BBB%';

-- 6. Find emails of users who received ad copy 2 in their campaign
SELECT email FROM users WHERE campaign LIKE '%-2';

-- 7. Find emails of users who received both a campaign and a test
SELECT email FROM users WHERE (campaign IS NOT NULL AND test IS NOT NULL);

-- 8. Challenge: Calculate how old users were when they signed up
SELECT 
    id,
    strftime('%Y', created_at) - strftime('%Y', birthday) AS age_at_signup
FROM 
    users;
```
